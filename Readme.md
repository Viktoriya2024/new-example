### Creation of remote-repo
- Some work done inside `ather` branch
- To simply create a branch we ill use command `git branch branchName`
- Then if we want ti switch to that branch we will use command `git checkout branchName`
- But if u want to create and switch to one command u use `git chekout -b branchName`
- How to delete a branch `git branch -d branchName` `this work is done - in secondBranch`
- The branch have the copy of the work from main / or branch from where it was created.
But they will have no idea if the main or their parent is update. "work done with thirdbranch"
